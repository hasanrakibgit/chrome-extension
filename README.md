## Idea from Scrimba

Since 2017, they have created over 20 free courses on Scrimba, and they're going to
continue launching free courses. But to pay they bills, they have to charge once
in a while. So if you've ever wanted to "give back" to Scrimba, you can do that by buying
	one of their paid courses

- [Become a professional React developer](https://scrimba.com/course/greact)
- [The Responsive Web Design Bootcamp](https://scrimba.com/course/gresponsive)
- [The Ultimate JavaScript Bootcamp](https://scrimba.com/course/gjavascript)

	It would also mean the world to them if you share the courses.  

Happy Coding!
